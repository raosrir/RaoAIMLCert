    "## What is the right price to pay for a used vehicle?\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest dilemma facing a customer in the market for a used automobile is \"what is a fair price for this vehicle?\". This question is more significant with a used vehicle purchase than a new one as there is no standard MSRP associated with the make, model, and year as with a new auto. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, used cars sold by private parties bring more uncertainly in pricing and quality into the mix making it a risky transaction. While it we will not address the quality risks, we can certainly take on the pricing problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will use the historical prices of used vehicles in Europe to device a model that would let a used auto buyer estimate the price they would expect to pay based on the main (yet basic) features of used vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The source of historical used car price data employed in this project was obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanskrutipanda/car-pricing-prediction\n"

    "2. The power of the engine\n",

    "* The power of the engine\n",
    "* Kilometers the vehicle has run (Odometer reading)\n",

    "This project to build a price estimator for used vehicles that the consumer/end user can rely on to help them with the vehicle buying process has been completed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the car's model, type of transmission (manual, automatic) or other features than the above mentioned five, did not have significant impact on the pricing. This means the buyer is free to select any of the other features of their choice without having to worry about paying a premium for it.\n",
